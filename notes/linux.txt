Boot process
BIOS first step after power on.
performs power on self test.(POST).installed on ROM chip.
OS takes charge after this

After BIOS control passes to boot loader, stored in MBR or UEFI
boot sector for BIOS/MBR
EFI partition for UEFI
Boot loader in turn loads the kernel and initial RAM disk.

Two stages of boot loader:


1st stage

BIOS/MBR- system locates the boot loader from first sector of hard disk know as MBR.
          In this stage boot loader searches for the partition table and locates the bootable partition.
          Once done, the searches for the 2nd stage boot loader (GRUB) and loads into RAM.
EFI/UEFI- UEFI firmware reads its boot manager data to determine which UEFI application has to be launched and from where..
          The firmware the launches the UEFI application (GRUB).



2nd stage:

second stage boot loader is under /boot. Present a splash screen to select the OS.
After the OS is selected, it loads the kernel into the memory.

initramfs-

initramfs contains programs and binaries that perform action needed to mount proper root filsystem.
udev figures out which devices are present in system, locating their drivers and loading them.

If everything goes fine.. initramfs is removed and init(/sbin/init) process is executed.
init mounts and pivots the real root filesystem.


Takeaway from boot loader section:
boot loader loads the kernel and initial RAM file system
