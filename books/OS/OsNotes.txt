Program is a passive entity and process is a active entity.
The central processor reads instructions from main memory during
the instruction-fetch cycle and both reads and writes data from main memory
during the data-fetch cycle (on a von Neumann architecture ).
Memory-addressing hardware ensures that a process can execute only within its own address space.
Computing environment..
virtualization
cloud-Cloud computing is a type of computing that delivers computing, storage, and even applications as a service across a network
simulation

/*Chapter 2*/
Three views to view operating system
1.The services it provides
2.Interface that it makes available to the users and programmers.
3.Various subsystems and its interconnection.

Operating-system services
Operating system provides services to the execution of program and its users.

System Calls:
System calls provide an interface to the services made available by an operating
system.
System call interface that serves as the link to system calls made available by the
operating system.
Most of the details of the operating-system interface
are hidden from the programmer by the API and are managed by the run-time
support library

Types of system call:
System calls can be grouped roughly into six major categories: process
control, file manipulation, device manipulation, information maintenance,
communications, and protection
